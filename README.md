This project leverages the Animal Crossing API to create a villager exploration platform.
Similar to how random villagers will appear on your island in the game, the main dashboard features
a random villager that you can either add to the villager roster or skip. Villagers added to the 
roster are displayed below the dashboard. In the game, you can only have 10 villagers on your 
island at a time. Similarly, the roster can only contain 10 villagers at a time. If you try to 
exceed this amount, you will be prompted to remove a villager from the roster. 

For the villagers in the roster, there is an info button for each that will take you to a summary 
for that villager. This summary includes the villager's profile picture, character details, and which 
villagers in the current roster are likely to get along or conflict with the current villager's personality type. 
(For example, lazy villagers conflict with jock villagers). In these personality based lists, you can
click on the icon for another villager to bring up their information page. There is also a button to
return home and a button for removing or registering the villager based on whether or not they're 
already in the roster. If the current villager is not in your roster and you already have 10 villagers
in your roster, you will not have the option to register them until you remove one. 

There is also a search bar, which can be accessed via the search button in the header. Once on the search 
page, you can enter either the exact name of a villager or a combination of letters, and any villager names 
that either match or include that sequence of characters will be returned. You can then click on the icons
for these returned characters to access their information pages. 

Several of my friends and I play Animal Crossing, and there are currently no outstanding websites that 
allow you to create a roster and compare personality types in this fashion. Though there are applications 
for browsing villagers, they lack the ability to directly compare personality types. The people I have 
shown this application to have praised the ease of it's user interface and really enjoy how easy it is 
to build up a roster (either through random selection or searching and adding specific villagers) and compare
the personalities of those specific villagers.

I would really like to add another search feature that would allow users to filter villagers either by 
personality type, species, or hobby.
